   // okay so in hangman there is a set of letters (probably use an array/string) that the user
   // has to guess correctly. if they guess wrong, then a body part is added to the gallow and 
   // the stick figure is slowly hung.
   // the way this could work in code is to have a function trigger a for loop to see if the letter entered
   // is correct (part of the string) or incorrect (not part of the string) and add a body part to the
   // gallow until the stickman is hung. you could do function guess(e){} (e is the letter being guessed
   // but as a parameter.) inside the function there is a for loop that checks if e matches any of the
   // letters in an array and then decides if its correct or incorrect

   // create an array for the letters of the word
   // create a variable for how many chances you have left, and when it equals 0 you D I E
   // create a function that takes in a letter as input --
   // put a for loop in said function that runs through the array of letters
   // put an if statement in said for loop that checks if the letter = the current letter in the array
   // if it isnt, tell them it's wrong and substract 1 from the chances variable
   // if it is, put the letter in some sorta spot idunno
