document.addEventListener("event-type", function)

objects: curly brackets
var car = { 
    doors: 2,
    name: "telsa",
    fast: true",
}

objects - made of key-value pairs
name: "mr. car" 
key     value
value pair 
also called a property

how to get stuff from an object: 
dot notation!!!
car.name is "mr. car"
car["name" is "mr. car"]



var xspeed = 1
var yspeed = 1
setInterval(box, 5)
function box(){
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, 2000, 2000)
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, w, h)
    x = x + xspeed
    y = y + yspeed
}

to find stuff like location, we need to find distance
we know things are touching if their x's and y's are in a certain radius of each other
